# Linkit - Enriched linking experience

## This is a port-in-progress and not functional yet.

Linkit provides an easy interface for internal and external linking with editors 
and fields by using an autocomplete field. Linkit links to nodes, users, managed 
files, terms and have basic support for all entities by default.

Linkit has three major advantages over traditional linking

  - The user does not have to copy or remember a URL.
  - It is a sustainable solution for internal linking.
  - It has a user friendy UI.
